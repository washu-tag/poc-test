# ADR: Selecting Vercel AI and Next.js for Agentic Data Exploration Application

## Context
We are developing an agentic application for data exploration through natural language querying, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and code interpreter for plotting and summarization. The application will be containerized and deployed in a Kubernetes environment.

## Decision
We will use Vercel AI SDK and Next.js as the frontend framework for our application.

## Rationale

### Pros
1. **Integrated AI capabilities**: Vercel AI SDK provides built-in support for streaming not only responses, but also React components themselves. This allows developers to stream fully customizable UI back to the user based on the AI's outputs. 
2. **React ecosystem**: Next.js is based on React, offering a vast ecosystem of libraries and components that can accelerate development.
3. **Server-side rendering (SSR)**: SSR is a technique where the initial HTML content is generated on the server for each request. In Next.js, SSR works as follows:
* When a user requests a page, Next.js renders the React components on the server.
* The server sends the fully rendered HTML to the client, along with the necessary JavaScript.
* The client's browser displays the HTML immediately, then "hydrates" the page, attaching event handlers and making it interactive.
4. **API routes**: Next.js API routes can simplify backend-frontend integration, potentially reducing the need for a separate API server.
5. **TypeScript support**: Both Next.js and Vercel AI SDK have excellent TypeScript support, enhancing code quality and developer experience.
6. **Performance optimizations**: Next.js includes various performance optimizations by default, such as automatic code splitting.
7. **Community and documentation**: Both technologies have large communities and extensive documentation, facilitating easier problem-solving and knowledge sharing.

### Cons
1. **Potential overhead**: Using Vercel AI SDK might introduce some overhead compared to a custom-built solution.
2. **Learning curve**: Team members unfamiliar with Next.js or Vercel AI SDK may require some time to adapt.
3. **Limited control over AI model selection**: Vercel AI SDK may constrain our choices of AI models or providers.
4. **Not using Vercel hosting**: We may not be able to leverage all Vercel-specific optimizations since we're using Kubernetes for deployment.

## Alternatives Considered
1. React with custom AI integration
2. Vue.js with Vue AI Utils
3. Svelte with SvelteKit AI

## Decision Consequences
1. We'll need to ensure our Docker container and Kubernetes setup are optimized for Next.js applications.
2. We may need to adapt some Vercel AI SDK features to work efficiently in our non-Vercel hosted environment.
3. We should plan for potential future migration if we outgrow Vercel AI SDK's capabilities.
4. Regular assessment of the AI landscape will be necessary to ensure we're not missing out on significant advancements not yet supported by Vercel AI.

## Implementation Notes
- Utilize Next.js's `output: 'standalone'` option for optimal containerization.
- Carefully configure API routes to work seamlessly within the Kubernetes environment.
- Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for AI-related features.

## Review Date
Six months from implementation, or sooner if significant challenges arise during development.
